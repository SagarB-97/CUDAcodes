This repository contains implementations of some parallel algorithms on **CUDA**. Each implementation is in a separate folder. Each folder has a `README.md` file containing instructions on how to run the program.

**List of algorithms implemented** : <br>

1. Vector Addition - Thrust Library
2. Image Blur
3. Color to Mono
4. Matrix Multiplication
5. Optimized Matrix Multiplication
6. Histogram - Numbers
7. Histogram - ASCII
8. Histogram sort (Thrust)
9. Convolution
10. Stencil-Tiling
